The purpose of the articles on this site is to provide information on exactly how I built snowboards at Happy Monkey Snowboards, Inc., 
so that others may learn from it. This will not be a comprehensive treatment of all the different ways to accomplish these tasks, but 
rather just the ways that I have personally done it that have yielded success. For alternatives to these techniques see 
[Skibuilders.com](http://www.skibuilders.com) and [GrafSnowboards.com](http://www.grafsnowboards.com), where they have collected detailed 
how-to’s on how they and others build boards, and have extensive and active forums with even more information on alternatives.

Enjoy,

## Questions? 

If you have any questions that aren’t answered in these articles, or clarification on something that is here, please don’t hesitate 
to contact me and I will do my best to help you out. I’m constantly answering questions and helping out other small builders, so don’t 
be shy. You can find direct contact information on my [user page]({{< ref "MonkeyWiki/Head_Monkey.md" >}}). There is a 
[thread at SkiBuilders on my processes](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2116) that may be helpful as well. 
I also recommend posting any questions you might have on the [Skibuilders forum](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/), where you will likely 
get a faster response from the community.
