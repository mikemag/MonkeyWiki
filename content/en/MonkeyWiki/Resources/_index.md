The following articles provide links and references for many of the basic skills, tools, and techniques of 
fields related to snowboard construction. These are resources that I’ve found very helpful as I’ve learned 
about woodworking, composites, metalworking, etc. 

- [Woodworking Resources]({{< ref "MonkeyWiki/Resources/Woodworking_Resources.md" >}})
- [Metalworking and Machining Resources]({{< ref "MonkeyWiki/Resources/Metalworking_and_Machining_Resources.md" >}})
