This site provides information on exactly how I build snowboards so that other may learn from it. 
The information here is based upon my experience building boards as owner of Happy Monkey Snowboards, Inc., from 2003-2010 as well as 
my continued personal building through 2018.

This will not be a comprehensive treatment of all the different ways to accomplish these tasks, but rather just the ways that I have 
personally done it which work well for me. For alternatives see [SkiBuilders.com](http://www.skibuilders.com), where they have collected 
detailed how-to’s on how they and others build siks and snowboards, and host a great forum with even more information on alternatives.

Enjoy,

## What about skis? 
I've built one pair of skis, and they turned out great. You’ll find that ski and snowboard construction are *amazingly* similar. 
You can use all of the information here to build either, even though it all refers to snowboards. It’s okay :)

## Status 
There are a few placeholders where I've left just raw notes, but otherwise the articles that are here now are technically 
correct and up-to-date.
