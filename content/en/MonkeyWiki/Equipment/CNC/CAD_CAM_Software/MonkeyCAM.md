MonkeyCAM v4.0 is an open source CAD/CAM program for designing skis and snowboards, and generating G-code programs to cut board parts with a CNC machine. 

Here is an overview of what MonkeyCAM generates: https://rawgit.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM/master/Sample-output/Sample-snowboard-overview.html

MonkeyCAM is published on Github at https://github.com/mikemag/MonkeyCAM where you can find documentation, examples, and download the program for Mac and Windows. There’s also a thread over at Skibuilders http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=4450

The value of MonkeyCAM over a generic CAD/CAM program is that it generates precisely the G-Code programs you need to build a ski or snowboard quickly without manual intervention. However, that’s all MonkeyCAM does. It won’t generate programs for anything else, so it’s still useful to have and know how to use a general purpose CAD/CAM system as well.
