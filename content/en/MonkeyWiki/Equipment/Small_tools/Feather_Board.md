{{< img src="images/Fingers.JPG" caption="_Feather board on a bandsaw._" >}}A feather board is a tool used to help hold work against the fence of a bandsaw or tablesaw. They can be adjusted so that a board has to push the ends of the feather board out of the way as it passes through the saw blades, thus applying a bit of pressure towards the fence.

Feather boards can be shop-made to any size or shape you need using bought hardware (knob and slot insert), or you can find them pre-made at your local woodworking shop.
