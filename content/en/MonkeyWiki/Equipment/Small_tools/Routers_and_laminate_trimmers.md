So much of core construction involves the trusty router. The primary router I use on my CNC machine is a [Porter Cable](http://www.portercable.com/) model 890 2 1/4hp router motor. The part number is 8902. It’s a solid router motor that’s pretty serviceable too.

For trimming sidewalls I use a Porter Cable Model 7301 laminate trimmer with a Model 7318 Tile Laminate Trimmer Base. The tilt base is awesome for trimming sidewalls. I prefer a laminate trimmer for sidewall work, or really any time I need to trim something to match a template, because it fits in the palm of your hand and is more easily controlled than a larger router.
