{{< img src="images/RouterBits1.JPG" caption="_Router bits._" >}}{{< img src="images/RouterBits2.JPG" >}}I greatly prefer bits from [Amana Tool](http://amanatool.com/). A quality router bit really does make a big difference. These are well balanced making the tool quieter, and yielding smoother cuts.
 
For cutting MDF for molds and most core cutting where a 1/4” bit is called for we use a two flute up-cut spiral carbide bit, **#46102**, running at 23,000rpm.
 
For profiling cores, I use a 1.5” two flute straight bit, **#45452**., running at 18,000rpm.
 
For placing alignment marks I use a 1/4″ v-groove bit, **#45704**, running at 23,000rpm.
 
For cutting base and nose/tail spacers, I use a 1/4″ two flute straight bit, **#45208**, running at 23,000rpm.
 
For sidewall profiling, I use a 1/4″ two flute straight bit with a top bearing running at 30,000rpm in the laminate trimmer. This is not an Amana bit… it’s an el-cheapo Home Depot bit that will be replaced with a good Amana bit when it wears out (which will be any day now by the looks of it.)
