Pipe clamps are useful for building core blanks. They apply reasonable force over a wide distance, and they can be made any length you want by using different pipes. The ends are easily adjusted for different clamping widths on the same pipe. I’ve added 2” x 2” x 12” oak cauls on each side of the clamps to distribute clamping force over a wider area.

The clamps I use came from Woodcraft, but you can find them almost anywhere. Buy pipe at something like Home Depot or Lowes: [Pipe Clamps](http://www.woodcraft.com/Product/2005440/16062/Jorgensen-Pony-Pipe-Clamp-34.aspx)
