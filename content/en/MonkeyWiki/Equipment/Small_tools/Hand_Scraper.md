A simple hand scraper is amazingly useful any time glue needs to be removed from something. I use this one during core blank construction to cleanup glue squeeze-out, cleaning up excess glue after insetting sidewalls, and even removing fuzz after certain stages of machining a core. You should be able to find one at any hardware store. Itâ€™s just a simple handle holding a hardened steel scraper. The blades can be rotated as they wear down.
