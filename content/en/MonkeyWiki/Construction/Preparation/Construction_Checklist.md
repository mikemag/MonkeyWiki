There are a lot of steps to building a snowboard, and it’s easy to forget some now and then especially when building multiple boards at once. There’s lots of things to do to prepare the materials, and lots of stuff to get ready for lamination. I keep track of exactly where I am in a build via a simple one-page spreadsheet. I print one of these for each build, and keep it with the board from core blank thru to finished product.

This includes things to be sure to do for core construction, wet layup, mold preparation, cleanup and finishing, etc.

To print: select "Fit to Page" for Scale, and under Formatting uncheck "Show gridlines".
