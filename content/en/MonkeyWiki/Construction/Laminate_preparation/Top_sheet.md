# Raw Notes
This is a temporary page containing raw, unedited notes on this subject. This page and the information here is incomplete, and may be inaccurate. 

- I use wood veneer for my top sheets, wetted out both sides with epoxy during layup.
- Standard "raw" wood veneer, i.e., not paper-backed. Typical thickness is around 0.026" or so. 
- I cut and join different woods, usually with a simple stripe down the center. It's easy to do and looks nice, and lets you combine a few different woods together.
- Veneer is joined with standard veneer tape on the underside. I wet this with epoxy carefully during layup and it stays inside the board. It's so thin it just doesn't matter.
- I've used some curved forms to cut long arcs in the veneer, and joined those. This was a pain in the ass though, fair warning. Cutting and joining thin veneer what doesn't lay flat well is quite hard.
- Try to use the flattest veneer you can find if you're joining it. It can be difficult to end up with a straight joint with very wavy, warped veneer.
- A long time ago I used pre-printed top sheets from Creative Edge Graphics in WA. These were PBT.
- I've also used clear top sheets. Some Duravision IIRC, and something else I need to look up. These are nice because you can see your top layer of fibers, core alignment, nose/tail spacer alignment, etc. You can also see if there are any dry spots due to poor wet out, voids, air bubbles, etc.
- Mark center lines on the edges of the topsheet so you can get it straight during layup. These marks match centering marks I have on the cassette. 
- Note how veneer colors change with pressing, and teach how I made my sample cards.
  - Old FB post: When I use wood veneer for my snowboard top sheets it always darkens. It's the epoxy and heat used during pressing. Since I got some new veneer I decided to make a bunch of test cards so I could see exactly what I'm working with. 10 different kinds of wood pressed with epoxy and fiberglass as if done for a snowboard, with white card stock glued to the backs for labels.
