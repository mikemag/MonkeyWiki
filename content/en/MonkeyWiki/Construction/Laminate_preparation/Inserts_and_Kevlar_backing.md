# Raw Notes
This is a temporary page containing raw, unedited notes on this subject. This page and the information here is incomplete, and may be inaccurate. 

- Kevlar, biax, woven, measured at 0.004", used for inserts, not sure of original width, but quite wide. 1.70 oz./yd.² (58 g/m²) Warp 34 Kevlar 49 195 Denier X Fill 34 Kevlar 49 195 Denier, Plain Weave, 3.0 mils (.08 mm) Thickness.
- Need info on the inserts: type, cap, source, heights, weights, typical number/spacing.
- Holes are cut on the CNC machine with programs from MonkeyCAM. The fit is snug, but does not require a hammer to get them in.
- Kevlar is pre-cut, slits pre-cut before layup. Wet the kevlar with epoxy during layup, place, and push inserts thru at that time. I keep a small tac hammer nearby just in case any insert is difficult to seat.
- {{< img src="images/Fibers3.JPG" >}}A patch of Kevlar which the inserts are pushed through provides stronger insert retention, and greatly reduces “binding suck”: that phenomena where the base underneath the bindings tends to suck in to the core when the bindings are tightened.
- The standard snowboard binding pattern is 4cm x 4cm, thus the "4x4" you typically see. You can add as many sets as you'd like, but recognize that you're drilling more and more holes in your core, and thru your top layer of glass. quite typical is 4 rows 4cm apart.
  - The "machine gun" pattern is staggering your rows by 2cm, so you have finer options for stance width at the expense of more holes and inserts.
  - There is a standard splitboard pattern developed by Voile. It can be found directly from them here: http://www.voile.com/voile_splitboard_hole_pattern_specs.pdf
    - I have archived this here: [[File:Voile_splitboard_hole_pattern_specs.pdf|File:Voile_splitboard_hole_pattern_specs.pdf]]
