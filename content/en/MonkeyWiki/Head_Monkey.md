I'm Mike Magruder, the founder of Happy Monkey Snowboards, Inc., which was from 2003-2010 a very small business where I built custom snowboards by hand. 
I continued to build boards for myself and close friends through 2018.
I was always trying to learn new ways to improve my processes, equipment, and final result.

You can contact me directly via email at '''monkeywiki1 at this domain''', or via private message to Head Monkey in the forum 
at [Skibuilders.com](http://www.skibuilders.com). I can also be found on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/mike.magruder) and

## Background

I have no formal background in anything that would be helpful manufacturing snowboards or running a snowboard business. 
Everything I know about snowboard construction, woodworking, CNC, or machining I learned by trial and error, talking with other builders, 
and the odd course or two on machining at a local technical college. 

My formal education is in computer science. I hold a MS in CS from George Mason University. 
Iâ€™ve [worked at a variety of different software companies since 1989.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemag/)
