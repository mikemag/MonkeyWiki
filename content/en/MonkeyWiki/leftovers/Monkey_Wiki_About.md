The purpose of the articles in this wiki is to provide information on exactly how I built snowboards at Happy Monkey Snowboards, Inc., so that others may learn from it. This will not be a comprehensive treatment of all the different ways to accomplish these tasks, but rather just the ways that I have personally done it that have yielded success. For alternatives to these techniques see [Skibuilders.com](http://www.skibuilders.com) and [GrafSnowboards.com](http://www.grafsnowboards.com), where they have collected detailed how-to’s on how they and others build boards, and have extensive and active forums with even more information on alternatives.

Enjoy,

## Questions? 

If you have any questions that aren’t answered in these articles, or clarification on something that is here, please don’t hesitate to contact me and I will do my best to help you out. I’m constantly answering questions and helping out other small builders, so don’t be shy. You can find direct contact information on my [[User:Head Monkey|user page]]. There is a [thread at SkiBuilders on my processes](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2116) that may be helpful as well. I also recommend posting any questions you might have on the [Skibuilders forum](http://www.skibuilders.com/phpBB2/), where you will likely get a faster response from the community.

## Contributions

I’ve used a wiki to organize and present the information I have on snowboard construction because:

1. It’s easy to structure the articles and provide different ways to explore the information.
1. History is tracked and easily viewed. Check out the “Recent Changes” link on the left.
1. Per-article subscription to watch for changes to the parts you care about.

However, unlike a traditional wiki **I am not allowing contributions or edits from others at this time**. You can create an account so you can get change notifications, but you can’t add or edit articles. It’s possible I may change this in the future, but for now this wiki is just to capture information about how I build snowboards.
